"""Regression test for hebrew.py -- and its scheme's authoritative
definition. If this file and hebrew.py's docstring disagree about what a
given input should produce, THIS FILE WINS; the docstring is a summary
that can drift.

All word-level cases are real OSHB word ids pulled from Joshua-words.tsv
(surface/lemma/morph looked up here by id at test time, never hand-typed).
Each expected value was worked out independently from the word's actual
Unicode codepoints (dumped and read directly, not recalled/typed from
memory) and the rules documented in hebrew.py's module docstring -- not
copied from transliterate_word()'s own output. Two of these hand
derivations (06VdU, 06bjL) initially missed a codepoint on a first pass
and were corrected after re-reading the dumped codepoints, which is the
point of doing it this way: the mistake was caught by re-deriving, not by
trusting the generator.

Covers every row of phase-0.6-plan.md's measured-output table (06b5Q is
covered by the closely analogous 06XR4/06K9n kol cases; melek itself
doesn't recur as a bare form early enough in Joshua to pull a cleaner id,
so the no-spirantization rule is instead exercised directly by 06XSi/
06j8W/065Pr/06bjL, each of which has a bare bet/kaf/pe in the old scheme's
spirantizing position), plus: kol/YHWH/Jerusalem overrides (bare and
prefixed), a Ketiv/Qere pair, word-initial shuruq, sin/shin-dot and
begadkefat minimal pairs, heavy niqqud/cantillation stacking, dagesh-forte
doubling (including a double-forte word and the "preposition assimilation"
gemination pattern shared with the article), silent vs. vocal sheva in
every position the rules distinguish, furtive patach, and tsere-yod
alongside hiriq-yod matres.
