"""Verification for audit_thread_coverage.py, written before any real
thread/unit exists (per house rule: verify before generator, not after --
Matthew's worst silent bug shipped across seven files before a verifier
existed for it).

Two parts:

1. An INDEPENDENT re-derivation of the source-side id-matching the audit
   does (`_independent_source_hits_for_root`), built separately -- its own
   Ketiv detection, its own bare-id parsing, csv.reader (not
   csv.DictReader, so even the row-access style differs from the audit's),
   and NOT importing roots.py's or audit_thread_coverage.py's matching
   functions. This is cross-checked against the real
   audit_thread_coverage.source_hits_for_root() for a handful of real ids
   (§5's kol=3605, and 3068/3389) -- if the two ever disagree, one of them
   has a bug, and this test is what would catch it.

   The old verify script's kol/Caleb stem-over-match regression doesn't
   apply anymore (nothing here does substring matching), so it's replaced
   with a live regression pulled from the TSV at check time: the id set
   {3605} must yield exactly as many word ids as there are Joshua-words.tsv
   rows with a lemma segment whose bare id is 3605, and none of those word
   ids may carry lemma 3612 (Caleb) -- the exact over-match id-based
   matching is designed to not have.

2. Synthetic fragment fixtures, built from REAL word ids/surface forms
   pulled from Joshua-words.tsv (never hand-typed), run through the real
   `coverage_for_fragment()` with a synthetic threads.json/roots.json.
   Each fixture is built to trigger exactly one of the five failure shapes
   the audit is supposed to catch: a gap, a wrong-lemma id, a missing
   data-w on a tracked span, a tagged id outside the unit's passage, and a
   tagged id that doesn't exist at all.
